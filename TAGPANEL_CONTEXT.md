# TagPanel — Error Tagging Workflow

## Overview

TagPanel is a bottom slide-up overlay triggered when a reviewer presses an event key.  
It follows a multi-step keyboard-only flow — no mouse, no typing.

```
Press event key (E, S, A...)
  → Step 1: Select error type (1-6)
  → Step 2: Select correction / extra (keyed list)
  → Step 3 (some paths): Select team (Home 1 / Away 2)
  → Auto-save
```

## Step 1 — Error Types

| Key | Error type | Auto-save? |
|-----|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Wrong event | No → Step 2 (correction list) |
| 2 | Missing event | ✅ Yes |
| 3 | Extra event | ✅ Yes |
| 4 | Missing extra | No → Step 2 (extra list) |
| 5 | Wrong extra | No → Step 2 (pick extra) → Step 3 (correction) |
| 6 | Not needed extra | No → Step 2 (extra list) |

---

## Step 2A — Wrong Event Corrections (per event)

Keys assigned sequentially: 1,2,3...9,Q,W,E...  
Lists shown in 2-column grid when >5 items.

## UI Behavior

- **Panel position:** Fixed bottom, full width, slides up — identical to original TagPanel
- **Backdrop:** Semi-transparent blur overlay — click to cancel
- **Breadcrumb:** Shows path e.g. `Pass → Wrong event → Miscontrol`
- **Step label:** Colored indicator above each list
- **Key display:** Every option shows its keyboard shortcut key in orange mono
- **2-column grid:** Used when list has >5 items to keep it compact
- **Auto-save types:** Missing event (2) and Extra event (3) save immediately with green "auto" badge
- **ESC:** Cancels at any step
- **GK special flow:** Sub-type picker appears first before error type

---

## TagPanel Data Sources

All data verified against:
- **Sheet1** (App_Shortcuts.xlsx): Events with their extras/sub-fields per event
- **Sheet2** (App_Shortcuts.xlsx): Error correction guide — col E (tagged), col F (error type), col G (correction)

**Sheet2 column structure:**
- Col A = Extra/Event name (reference)
- Col C = Sub-type label (GK only)
- Col D = Sub-type shortcut
- Col E = What was tagged (the wrong thing)
- Col F = Error type (Wrong event / Missing extra / Wrong extra / etc.)
- Col G = Correction (what it should have been)
- Col I = Sub-type of correction (GK sub-type)

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Keep original panel position/style | Don't break muscle memory of reviewers |
| 2-column keyed grid for long lists | Max 6 rows visible vs 11 in single column |
| Keys 1-9 then Q,W,E,R... | Sequential, no gaps, easy to memorize |
| Missing/Extra event → auto-save | No correction needed, fastest path |
| Wrong extra has 2 sub-steps | First pick which extra was wrong, then which value to correct to |
| GK sub-type first | GK has 4 different sub-events with different wrong-event corrections |
| Per-event filtering | Show only extras relevant to that event — not a global 32-item list |
| Team selection last | Same pattern as original panel — confirms intent before save |

## v4.1.0 Status (2026-06-11) — Sheet-Driven Taxonomy Available But Not Yet Wired Into TagPanel

The official error-correction taxonomy is now structured data in the repo at `src/data/tagging_scenarios.js`:

- **465 rules** sourced from `Untitled_spreadsheet (1).xlsx` (provided 2026-06-11)
- **23 parent events** with shortcuts (see canonical list below)
- **17 error types** (canonical capitalization from the sheet, not snake_case)
- **Three filter helpers** exported alongside the raw `TAGGING_SCENARIOS` array:
  - `getErrorTypesForEvent(eventName)` — Step 2 list, filtered for the event
  - `getCorrectionsForScenario(eventName, errorType)` — Step 3 list, filtered for (event + error type)
  - `getTypeQualifiersForCorrection(eventName, errorType, correction)` — Step 4 list, only non-empty for corrections that have qualifiers (Goal keeper variants etc.)

**As of v4.1.0, `TagPanel.jsx` still uses its own hardcoded constants** (`ERROR_TYPES`, `WRONG_EVENT_MAP`, `WRONG_EXTRAS`, `MISSING_EXTRAS`, `EXTRAS`, `GK_SUBTYPES`, `GK_EXTRAS`, `GK_WRONG_EXTRAS`, `GK_WRONG_EVENT_MAP`). The new helpers are sitting in the repo waiting to be consumed.

### Why this was deferred

The v4.1.0 work mistakenly rewired `ErrorTagModal.jsx` instead of `TagPanel.jsx` — `ErrorTagModal.jsx` is dead code (never imported by any page). The data file infrastructure landed correctly; the consumer migration is pending.

### v4.2.0 migration plan (queued)

1. Read `TagPanel.jsx`'s current hardcoded maps and tabulate what they produce for each event
2. Diff that against `tagging_scenarios.js` to find anywhere TagPanel's data is stale or inconsistent with the latest sheet
3. Replace the hardcoded `WRONG_EVENT_MAP`, `WRONG_EXTRAS`, etc., with calls to the helpers from `tagging_scenarios.js`
4. Keep TagPanel's existing UI shape exactly the same (the keyed grid layout, the 1–9 → Q,W,E,R… key sequencing, the team selection step, auto-save behavior for Missing/Extra event) — only swap the data layer
5. Delete the dead `src/components/ErrorTagModal.jsx`

### Canonical event list (from the sheet, as of 2026-06-11)

| Event | Shortcut |
|---|---|
| Ball recovery | R |
| Block | B |
| Card | (mouse) |
| Clearance | F |
| Dribble | D |
| Fifty fifty | (sheet says mouse — MARK keeps key 0) |
| Foul committed | X |
| Goal Keeper | G |
| Hold up duel | H |
| Interception | V |
| Leg stretch duel | (sheet says U — MARK keeps M) |
| Miscontrol | T |
| Pass | E |
| Pass (First time) | (sheet says Q — MARK skipped, Q is Missing Event) |
| Pass interception | I |
| Pass recovery | (sheet says P — MARK skipped, P is Pressure) |
| Positioning duel | Y |
| Pressure start | (sheet says G — shares with Goal Keeper, likely an attribute) |
| Reception | W |
| Separation duel | (sheet says J — MARK keeps L) |
| Shield | C |
| Shot | S |
| Tackle | (sheet says A — MARK keeps K) |

### Canonical error-type list (17, in sheet order)

Wrong event · Missing event · Extra event · Wrong outcome · Wrong height · Wrong direction · Wrong body part · Wrong technique · Wrong GK body state · Wrong type · Wrong kind · Wrong side · Wrong extra · Missing extra · Not needed extra · Missing Outcome · Not needed Outcome

Frequency in the sheet (largest first): Wrong event 141 · Wrong body part 66 · Wrong type 60 · Wrong technique 32 · Wrong extra 30 · Missing event 20 · Extra event 20 · Wrong direction 20 · Wrong outcome 18 · Missing extra 16 · Not needed extra 16 · Wrong GK body state 12 · Wrong height 6 · Missing Outcome 2 · Not needed Outcome 2 · Wrong kind 2 · Wrong side 2.

### Removed concepts (not in the official taxonomy)

- "Wrong Player" — was a MARK-only option, not in the sheet. Will be removed from TagPanel during v4.2.0 migration unless explicitly kept by request.
- "Confused With" — duplicated "Wrong event". Will be removed during migration.
